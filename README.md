# VACCINEED...VIRTUAL QUEUE FOR COVID-19 VACCINATION


**WHY THIS?**

Covid vaccine distribution seems to be very difficult in the lockdown. Therefore, to prevent
virus spread and maintain social distancing during this process, we came up with the
idea of virtual queueing for covid -19 vaccine distribution system. This will also help in
keeping a check on black marketing of vaccines.


**DESCRIPTION:**

A platform where a citizen using his/her aadhar card can register and book a slot for
COVID-19 vaccination.

Basically there will be 2 users:

ADMIN:

● Will have the access to all the slot booking data.

● Keep a check on vaccine requirements.

● Will have the authority to accept someone’s emergency request.

CITIZEN:

● Will register using aadhar card and other medical details after which he will be given
a token number.

● Can check his status in the queue.

● Can appeal for an emergency request to get a vaccine early by giving valid reasons
and medical proofs.

● Can use chatbot to ask any question or query.

**FUTURE WORK:**

I. Location wise center distribution
   
   According to the user's address (extracted from aadhar details) locations of various
   vaccination centers will be given.

II. Fingerprints authentication
   
   Fingerprints will be used to authentify the user in case someone does not have
   aadhar card.

III. Online payment for vaccine
